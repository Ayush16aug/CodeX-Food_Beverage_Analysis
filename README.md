<h3>What kind of marketing campaigns, offers, and discounts we can run?</h3>

--Social Media
--Influencer Marketing
--Online Retailers/E-commerce
--Guerilla Marketing


<h3>Social Media</h3>

We have seen in the insights that our consumers fall in the age group of 15 to 30. This age group is very much active on social media. Also, they get to know about the products from online ads. Running Social Media Ads can be a good strategy to reach them.

<h3>Influencer Marketing</h3>h

**Cheap** –
Influencer marketing can be very cheap we set a strategy to target influencers and their audiences. We can work on a barter system or by paying some amount to the influencers.
**Collaborating with local influencers (multiple Macro & Micro)** –
We can collaborate with the influencers with the following of 10k to 100k, then 100k to 500k and so on. This will help our brand with branding and sales.
**Giveaway to Influencers and their Followers** –
Providing our products to consumers via influencers can help in changing brand perception.
**Exclusive Coupons and Discounts** –
Providing these discount coupons and exclusive offers will help us in retaining our customers. This will also play a role in remarketing by not spending money again and again on these campaigns.


<h3>Online Retailers/E-commerce</h3>

E-commerce and online grocery store do have their own PPC platforms. We can run paid ads on these platforms to increase the sale of the product because we are still not as well known by the consumers as the other brands.

<h3>Guerilla Marketing</h3>

**Consumers are buying products from supermarkets** –
We need to do some kind of special displays in supermarkets like renting and setting up a counter, or paying supermarkets for a space to display our products exclusively.
**Participate in Events** –
Like in Delhi The Grub Fest, Horn-oK-Please and similar food festival events. We can do some creative campaigns here to attract consumers and provide free testers to get more feedback on tasting to get reasonable insights.
Who can be a brand ambassador, and why?

While choosing the influencers, we need to keep in mind that we have to consider certain factors in mind.
1. **Budget** – Celebrity influencers charge more money according to their following and impact on social media.
2. **Relevancy** – Energy drinks are consumed by consumers who like to do some sort of physical activity. So, the celebrity should be a sportsperson, athlete or person indulged in some physical activity.
3. **Impact** – It is important to have an impact on their followers. Not every celebrity is influential but can still be followed by a vast audience. A celebrity who can influence the buying decision needs to be our brand ambassador.


<h4>I have selected 2 influencers keeping these 3 things in mind who can be our brand ambassadors.</h4>
